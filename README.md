In this deliveravle I was given a data a "mosquito tracking" dataset from the years 2008-2019. This data focused largely on the spread of West Nile Virus (WNV) in the city of Chicago. 
My first task was to perform basic and advanced EDA as well as data wrangling to get familiar with the dataset. After doing this, my second task was to understand the relationship between the different variables in the data set as well as the probability of finding West Nile Virus (WNV) at any particular time and location.
